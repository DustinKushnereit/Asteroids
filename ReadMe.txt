Game Description

With the arcade classic Asteroids having existed for a few decades now, people have
reproduced it time and time again. In an effort to look new and improved, this version
of Asteroids adds in several new features. Basic game play is still reminiscent of the
original Asteroids. Just shoot all the incoming asteroids to increase your points
and move on the next level. If you or your partner loses all their lives, the game is over
and you'll have to try again.

Unique Features and Parts of the Game

Each player shoots 4 bullets at once. The bullets fire in 4 different directions based on the players
rotation. This is inteded to make the players work together and rely on each other more.
Rather than know exactly how you will fire based on where the "main" point of your ship is directed,
you must instead cover your lack of "knowing" where the bullets will fire by using co-operation
and double ship fire.
Each player has 8 directional movement and full 360 degree rotation.
Each successive round increases the points recieved from shooting an asteroid.
Getting hit by an asteroid gives the player zero points.
There's a time limit on player repsawn.
Each successive level increases asteroid size.
The smaller the asteroid, the faster it is.
After level 2, asteroids start coming from the right side, and shoot across the screen to the left side.
Asteroids wrap around the screen.
Players are limited to the screen space and cannot travel beyond the screen.
Players weapons have a limit on how fast they can fire.
Each asteroid killed spawns two in it's place.

!IMPORTANT!

The networking code isn't finished as James and I ran out of time during the semester to work on this game.
Becuase of this, the game becomes quickly desynced. But it is possible to play this game locally,
without any networking. Simply launch the server and then launch 2 clients. After the game starts,
minimize one of the clients and continue playing with one keyboard on one machine.
The game will still work and play fine with two players. You just need to leave both clients open and
play on one of them.
