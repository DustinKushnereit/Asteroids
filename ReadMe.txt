Game Description

With the arcade classic Asteroids having existed for a few decades now, people have
reproduced it time and time again. In an effort to look new and improved, this version
of Asteroids adds in several new features. Basic game play is still reminiscent of the
original Asteroids. Just shoot all the incoming asteroids to increase your points
and move on the next level. If you or your partner loses all their lives, the game is over
and you'll have to try again.
